## Internship Timeline

### Phase 1: Learning (Weeks 1‚Äì4)

#### Week 1 ‚Äì Python & Programming Foundations
- Installed **Anaconda** and configured **Jupyter/VS Code** environments.
- Learned core Python: variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions, file I/O.
- Explored data structures: lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries.
- Basics of **Git/GitHub** (clone, branch, commit, PR).

#### Week 2 ‚Äì Data Handling, EDA & Visualization
- **NumPy:** arrays, broadcasting, vectorized operations.
- **Pandas:** loading CSVs, merging datasets, cleaning data, handling missing values, encoding.
- **Matplotlib**/**Seaborn:** histograms, bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, heatmaps.
- Fundamentals of **EDA** to identify patterns and class balance.

#### Week 3 ‚Äì Machine Learning & Image Processing
- Learned ML concepts: supervised vs. unsupervised learning, bias/variance, overfitting/underfitting.
- Implemented **Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest** using **scikit-learn**.
- Image preprocessing with **OpenCV**/**Pillow**: resizing, normalization, augmentation.
- Performed train/validation/test splits, evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### Week 4 ‚Äì Deep Learning & Flask Basics
- Studied **Neural Networks**: layers, activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax), loss functions, and optimizers.
- Built **CNNs** with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, Dense layers; applied regularization and augmentation.
- Created an image classifier using **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- Learned **Flask** basics: routing, templates, forms, and integrating ML inference APIs.

---

### Phase 2: Project (Weeks 5‚Äì8)

#### Week 5 ‚Äì Dataset Preparation
- Curated and preprocessed the **PlantVillage** dataset.
- Applied resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model performance.

#### Week 6 ‚Äì Model Development
- Designed a CNN architecture in **Keras** for leaf disease classification.
- Implemented early stopping and checkpointing to save the best model.

#### Week 7 ‚Äì Model Evaluation & Optimization
- Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction quality.

#### Week 8 ‚Äì Web Integration & Final Testing
- Integrated the trained model into **Flask**.
- Built a responsive UI with **Bootstrap** and implemented user authentication.
- Conducted final testing to ensure smooth predictions and fast load times.
