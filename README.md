## Overview
This repository showcases my **AI/ML Developer** internship at **TechMicra**.  
- **Weeks 1‚Äì4:** I focused on learning the foundations required for AI/ML and this project.  
- **Weeks 5‚Äì8:** I built a production-style web app for **plant disease detection**, weather insights, and crop management.

## Internship Timeline

### Phase 1: Learning (Weeks 1‚Äì4)

#### Week 1 ‚Äî Python & Programming Foundations
- Installed **Anaconda** and configured **Jupyter/VS Code** environments.
- Core Python: variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions, file I/O.
- Data structures: lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries.
- Basics of **Git/GitHub** (clone, branch, commit, PR).

#### Week 2 ‚Äî Data Handling, EDA & Visualization
- **NumPy**: arrays, broadcasting, vectorized ops.
- **Pandas**: loading CSVs, merging, cleaning, missing values, encoding.
- **Matplotlib**/**Seaborn**: histograms, bar/line charts, scatter, heatmaps.
- Fundamentals of **EDA** for discovering class balance & patterns.

#### Week 3 ‚Äî Machine Learning & Image Processing
- ML concepts: supervised vs. unsupervised, bias/variance, over/underfitting.
- Implemented **Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest** with **scikit-learn**.
- Image preprocessing with **OpenCV**/**Pillow**: resizing, normalization, augmentation.
- Train/validation/test splits, metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1).

#### Week 4 ‚Äî Deep Learning & Flask Basics
- **Neural Networks**: layers, activations (ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax), loss & optimizers.
- **CNNs**: Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, Dense; regularization & augmentation.
- Built an image classifier with **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- **Flask** basics: routing, templates, forms, integrating ML inference APIs.

### Phase 2: Project (Weeks 5‚Äì8)

- **Week 5:** Dataset curation & preprocessing (resize, normalize, augment).
- Curated and preprocessed a PlantVillage dataset.
- Applied resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model performance.
- **Week 6:** CNN architecture design & training with Keras; early stopping/checkpointing.
- Built a CNN architecture with Keras for leaf disease classification.
- Used early stopping and checkpointing to save the best model.
- **Week 7:** Evaluation & optimization; confusion matrix, hyperparameter tuning.
- Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Tuned hyperparameters to improve prediction quality.
- **Week 8:** Flask integration, UI with Bootstrap, authentication, final testing & docs.
- Integrated the trained model into Flask.
- Created a responsive UI with Bootstrap and implemented user authentication.
- Conducted final testing, ensuring smooth predictions and fast loading times.
